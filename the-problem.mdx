description: 'Understanding the challenges in token emissions and incentive programs'

The most successful token networks reserve a significant portion of their token supply for incentives, growth, development, validators, and community building. But it's unclear how many incentives are needed and what inflation or emission rate is needed to bootstrap a vibrant token network. Demands change over time, farmers try to extract community rewards, DAOs politic.

A significant number of pre-token teams launch point programs in order to retain as much optionality as possible. Decision markets could predict optimal rates to grow token price. However, current infrastructure on binary decisions doesn't scale.

Current futarchy tech could ask: "Should emissions to traders be 2M tokens / day? Yes / No". But the optimal emission rate might be 3M / day or 1.5M a day. It is not trivial to test every number simultaneously.
