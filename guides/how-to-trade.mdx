# How to Trade

This section explains how to trade on traditional (non-quantum) decision markets on percent.

## Getting Started

Each user gets a client-side wallet to execute trades and hold positions with. Once you log in, you should be able to access your wallet in the top-right of the header. From there, you can either add funds by sending your desired token to the address.

## Enter a Market

In order to participate in a decision market, you need to enter a market with either SOL or the target token. In this walkthrough, we will give examples using $ZC and $SOL.

- Entering a market with 100 ZC splits your token into 100 pass-ZC and 100 fail-ZC
- Entering a market with 2 SOL splits your token into 2 pass-SOL and 2 fail-SOL

## Trading

The percent frontend allows you to first choose whether you'd like to bet on the pass market or the fail market.

The **pass market** represents the price of $ZC if a proposal passes. The **fail market** represents the price of $ZC if a proposal fails to pass.

Trading on the pass market allows you to exchange pass-ZC for pass-SOL and vice versa. This will only affect the pass market $ZC price.

Trading on the fail market allows you to exchange fail-ZC for fail-SOL and vice versa. This will only affect the fail market $ZC price.

This allows you to express your belief on what you think the price of $ZC should be if a ZC-related proposal passes or fails.

## Exiting a Market

If you have sufficient ZC or SOL on both the pass and fail markets, you're able to combine the tokens and exit the market.

### What does that mean?

Let's say you have 100 pass-ZC and 80 fail-ZC. You're able to withdraw 80 $ZC from the market. Afterwards you will be left with 80 $ZC (in your privy wallet), 0 pass-ZC and 20-fail ZC.

This also applies to SOL.

## Claiming

After the decision market resolves, you will be able to claim tokens from the resolving market.

Let's say a proposal ended up failing and you have 50 pass-ZC and 75 fail-ZC as well as 2 pass-SOL and 1 fail-SOL.

This means you will be able to claim 75 ZC and 1 SOL from the fail market. The pass market tokens are deemed worthless / non claimable.
