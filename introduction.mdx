percent is building infrastructure for market based token emissions.

The best token launches reward community and network growth with token incentives. Unfortunately, tokenomics need to be airtight to prevent farming and induce growth. Current futarchy tech works well on supply management but only for binary decisions. You can't optimize continuous variables like emission rates and distribution of emissions.

percent is building quantum markets, a mechanism for scaling futarchy, in order to run multiple decision markets simultaneously.

Join us as we build the future of tokenomics.

## The Problem

The most successful token networks reserve a significant portion of their token supply for incentives, growth, development, validators, and community building. But it's unclear how many incentives are needed and what inflation or emission rate is needed to bootstrap a vibrant token network. Demands change over time, farmers try to extract community rewards, DAOs politic.

A significant number of pre-token teams launch point programs in order to retain as much optionality as possible. Decision markets could predict optimal rates to grow token price. However, current infrastructure on binary decisions doesn't scale.

Current futarchy tech could ask: "Should emissions to traders be 2M tokens / day? Yes / No". But the optimal emission rate might be 3M / day or 1.5M a day. It is not trivial to test every number simultaneously.
