title: What is percent?
description: 'Building infrastructure for market based token emissions'

The best token launches reward community and network growth with token incentives. Designing tokenomics is hard. They need to be airtight to prevent farming and induce growth.

Current futarchy tech works well for supply based decisions as long as they are binary. 

Unfortunately, this means you can't optimize continuous variables like emission rates and distribution of emissions via futarchy. 

percent is building [quantum markets](/quantum-markets), a mechanism for scaling futarchy, in order to create market-governed incentive systems.

Join us as we build the future of token launches.
