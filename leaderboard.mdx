# Leaderboard

Prior to the development of decision markets, the percent team built a leaderboard to incentivize network growth for it's upcoming token launch â€” we intimately experienced the very problem we're looking to solve.

## Phase 1

In Phase 1, the leaderboard rewards the following behavior:
- following and referring large CT accounts
- being and remaining an early $oogway holder and staker
- driving engagement to percent

## Phase 2

In Phase 2, the percent team will work with tokenholders to structure retroactive rewards for leaderboard participants. All rewards, additional point parameters, and amounts will be determined via decision market.

The market will ultimately decide the amount of rewards that should be directed to leaderboard participants based on whether rewards are beneficial for the token price. Adjustment can be made to the leaderboard to improve reward rates.
