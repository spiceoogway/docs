percent is building infrastructure for market based token emissions.

The best token launches reward community and network growth with token incentives. Unfortunately, tokenomics need to be airtight to prevent farming and induce growth. Current futarchy tech works well on supply management but only for binary decisions. You can't optimize continuous variables like emission rates and distribution of emissions.

percent is building quantum markets, a mechanism for scaling futarchy, in order to run multiple decision markets simultaneously.

Join us as we build the future of tokenomics.

## The Problem

The most successful token networks reserve a significant portion of their token supply for incentives, growth, development, validators, and community building. But it's unclear how many incentives are needed and what inflation or emission rate is needed to bootstrap a vibrant token network. Demands change over time, farmers try to extract community rewards, DAOs politic.

A significant number of pre-token teams launch point programs in order to retain as much optionality as possible. Decision markets could predict optimal rates to grow token price. However, current infrastructure on binary decisions doesn't scale.

Current futarchy tech could ask: "Should emissions to traders be 2M tokens / day? Yes / No". But the optimal emission rate might be 3M / day or 1.5M a day. It is not trivial to test every number simultaneously.

## Quantum Markets

Our inspiration for building quantum markets comes from Alpin Yukseloglu and Sofaine Larbi writing at Paradigm, proph3t's implementation of MetaDAO, and Robin Hanson's work on futarchy.

Quantum markets represent an evolution of decision markets, from evaluating a 1 proposal to evaluating n proposal simultaneously.

We believe that the near-term best use case for quantum markets is in helping identify optimal emissions for token network growth.

Instead of:
- running obscure point programs that inevitably disappoint users
- deciding on a fixed emission rate and fixed % of supply for rewards, effectively preventing flexibility
- forgoing token incentives altogether
- running back-to-back decision markets to try to find the right emission rate

Quantum markets allow for the market to select a wide range of emission rates that optimize for the success of the token network.

These are not separate markets for each option. It is one mechanism, with multiple futures, and optimal selection.

Every token and crypto product interested in bootstrapping their token network would benefit from more efficient and allocation of token incentives.
