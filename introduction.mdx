percent is building infrastructure for market based token emissions.

The best token launches reward community and network growth with token incentives. Unfortunately, tokenomics need to be airtight to prevent farming and induce growth. Current futarchy tech works well on supply management but only for binary decisions. You can't optimize continuous variables like emission rates and distribution of emissions.

percent is building quantum markets, a mechanism for scaling futarchy, in order to run multiple decision markets simultaneously.

Join us as we build the future of tokenomics.
