description: 'How percent leverages ZCombinator for decision market development'
---

ZCombinator tokens currently have a fixed emission rate of 1M tokens / day. percent believes that this rate and it's allocation can be optimized with decision markets.

Additionally, ZCombinator is a permissionless bonding curve launchpad. This enables fast iteration, widespread adoption, and real developer feedback for decision market development.

We believe that decision markets and futarchy are helpful in solving the deepest problems faced by token developers of all market caps.

We're also launching on ZCombinator ourselves paired with the $ZC token - a bet on what we think the infrastructure can do to the ecosystem.

If we're directionally correct about the need for decision markets, then every token launch needs this.
